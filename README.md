# About Orwell
**Orwell is a technical essay analyzer that prioritizes constructive technical writing suggestions over enforcing rigid writing rules**. Most AI writing tools today focus on fixing grammar or suggesting better words—generalized corrections, designed to homogenize a writer’s voice, rather than augment it.

In contrast, Orwell was designed and developed to serve as a thoughtful peer reviewer, a “margin muse” who has studied thousands of technical essays to identify patterns that make explanations clearer or ideas flow better.

Michael Dean’s essay, [Essay Writing as Personal Sovereignty](https://cosmosinstitute.substack.com/p/essay-writing-as-personal-sovereignty) (2024), inspired this project. A key takeaway from the essay is the idea of using AI to preserve the slow craft of critical thought—use pattern recognition to elucidate what makes technical writing work, while leaving creative control firmly in the writer’s hands. Writing remains one of the most effective ways to learn deeply, and relegating that activity entirely to AI risks diminishing an individual’s intellectual growth.

From a personal standpoint, I have plans of writing in the future, and developing Orwell as part of my personal productivity suite was my agency trying to preserve my slow craft of critical thought.

## Models used
Orwell’s analysis uses DistilBERT, a transformer model pretrained on the BERT corpus by HuggingFace, which is a popular framework for NLP projects. DistilBERT is combined with a feedforward neural network for classification and scoring.
